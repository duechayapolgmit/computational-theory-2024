# Computation Theory Repository
*By Chayapol "Due" Hongsrimuang (G00388741)*

This is the repository for all the work that has been done in Atlantic Technological University's Computation Theory module for Software Development in academic year 2023-2024.

This repository contains one Jupyter notebook, `countdown.ipynb`, where all the work of the project are done.

## Setting Up
These are the programs that are required to run the notebook and repository locally:
1. Anaconda (or Python)
2. Git
3. Visual Studio Code

To view the project, these are the steps that are required:
1. Install all the prerequisite programs mentioned.
2. Clone the repository into a directory.
3. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
4. Select the notebook, `countdown.ipynb` in the Explorer tab. If the Explorer tab is not opened, it can be opened by pressing the button or using the keystroke `Ctr+Shift+E`.
5. Click "Run All" to run the code blocks at first. This is required to set up some necessary variables and functions that are correlated with each other within code blocks.
6. Each code block can then be run individually via pressing the play button besides the block.

# Running the Notebook
With all the functionalities being separated into code blocks, all code blocks have to be run at first, in order for all variables and functions to work (as mentioned above) This can be done by clicking the "Run All" button at the top of the notebook.

However, to fully run a random game of the numbers game, this can be done with the same exact way by clicking the "Run All" button. This will re-generate the numbers pool and the target number, alongside executing the main `solve_numbers()` function.
